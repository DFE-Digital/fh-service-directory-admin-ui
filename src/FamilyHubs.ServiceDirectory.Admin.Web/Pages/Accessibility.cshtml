        <p>
            This accessibility statement applies to Connect families to support.
        </p>
        <p>This website is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.</p>
        <p>
            For example, that means you should be able to:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-left-4">
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
