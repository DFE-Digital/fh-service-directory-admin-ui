   The ReadingLevel integer should be the reading age required to read and comprehend the content. Consider sentence complexity, vocabulary, content depth, paragraph length, and topic relevance.
   
InappropriateLanguage should flag whether the content contains inappropriate language.
If the flag is true, then the Instances array should contain objects with a Reason property and a Content property.
The Reason property should be a string describing why the content is inappropriate, and the Content property should be the text that is inappropriate.

Security is similar to InappropriateLanguage, but should flag whether the content contains security vulnerabilities.

PoliticisedSentiment is similar to InappropriateLanguage, but should flag whether the content contains politicised sentiment.

PII is similar to InappropriateLanguage, but should flag whether the content potentially contains personally identifiable information.
It is allowed to contain the name of a person if they are part of running the service, but not if they are a user of the service.

GrammarAndSpelling is similar to InappropriateLanguage, but should flag whether the content contains grammar or spelling mistakes.
The reason for a spelling mistake should be 'Spelling'. Grammatical mistakes should be flagged with the name of the type of grammatical mistake.
Example grammatical mistakes include:

    There vs. Their
    Your vs. You’re
    Affect vs. Effect

StyleViolations is similar to InappropriateLanguage, but should flag whether the content contains style violations.
Each instance should quote the name in the Reason instance field.
The style rules are:

Name: A*, A*s
Rule: The top grade in A levels. Use the symbol * not the word ‘star’. No apostrophe in the plural.

Name: A level
Rule: No hyphen. Lower case level.

Name: Abbreviations and acronyms
Rule: The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it’s well known, like UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT and MP. This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials, and use acronym Markdown so the full explanation is available as hover text.
   Do not use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

Name: the academies programme
Rule: Lower case.


further style rules:
todo: will either have to use a model with a big enough context, or just pick out what seem the most important rules to apply



   academy
   
   Only use upper case when referring to the name of an academy, like Mossbourne Community Academy. See also Titles.
   academy converters
   
   Lower case.
   academy order
   
   Lower case.
   academy trust
   
   Lower case.
   Access to Work
   
   Upper case when referring directly to the actual programme, otherwise use lower case.
   accountancy service provider
   
   Upper case when referring to the business area covered by Money Laundering Regulations. Do not use the acronym.
   Accounts Office
   
   Upper case.
   Activation PIN
   
   Upper case. Activation PIN has been changed to Activation Code on outgoing correspondence from the Government Gateway. Until all hard-coded instances of Activation PIN have been removed from the Online Services pages, use ‘Activation Code (also known as Activation PIN)’.
   act, act of Parliament
   
   Lower case. Only use upper case when using the full title: Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, for example.
   Active voice
   
   Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.
   Addresses in the UK
   
   Start each part of the address on a new line. You should:
   
       write the town and postcode on separate lines
       not use commas at the end of each line
       write the country on the line after the postcode, not before
       only include a country if there is a reasonable chance that the user will be writing to the address from a different country
   
   For example:
   
   HM Revenue and Customs - Child Benefit Office
   PO Box 1
   Newcastle Upon Tyne
   NE88 1AA
   United Kingdom
   Addressing the user
   
   Address the user as ‘you’ where possible and avoid using gendered pronouns like ‘he’ and ‘she’. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action: ‘You can contact HMRC by phone and email’ or ‘Pay your car tax’, for example.
   Adoption Register
   
   Upper case when referring to the national Adoption Register.
   
   Lower case in subsequent mentions that do not use the full term: the register.
   adviser
   
   For example, special adviser. Not advisor, but advisory is the correct adjective.
   ages
   
   Do not use hyphens in ages unless to avoid confusion, although it’s always best to write in a way that avoids ambiguity. For example, ‘a class of 15 16-year-old students took the A level course’ can be written as ‘15 students aged 16 took the A level course’. Use ‘aged 4 to 16 years’, not ‘4-16 years’.
   
   Avoid using ‘the over 50s’ or ‘under-18s’. Instead, make it clear who’s included: ‘aged 50 years and over’ and ‘aged 17 and under’.
   agile
   
   Upper case when referring to the Agile Manifesto and principles and processes, otherwise use lower case.
   allow list
   
   Use allow list as the noun and allow as the verb. Do not use white list or whitelist.
   al-Qa’ida
   
   Not al-Qaeda or al-Qaida.
   alternative provision
   
   Lower case.
   American and UK English
   
   Use UK English spelling and grammar. For example, use ‘organise’ not ‘organize’, ‘modelling’ not ‘modeling’, and ‘fill in a form’, not ‘fill out a form’.
   
   American proper nouns, like 4th Mechanized Brigade or Pearl Harbor, take American English spelling.
   Ampersand
   
   Use and rather than &, unless it’s a department’s logo image or a company’s name as it appears on the Companies House register.
   animal health
   
   Lower case.
   antisocial
   
   No hyphen.
   applied general qualifications

   Apostrophe, no hyphen.
   assembly ministers
   
   Lower case.
   artificial intelligence
   
   Write first as artificial intelligence (AI) then AI throughout.
   Attendance Allowance
   
   Upper case.
   Bacs (Bankers Automated Clearing System)
   
   Acronym should come first as it’s more widely known than the full name. Please note that the acronym has changed to Bacs.
   backend
   
   Used in a technical context, not “back-end” or “back end”.
   Bank details
   
   When adding bank details:
   
       do not use a table - use bullet points and a lead-in line instead
       use spaces rather than hyphens in sort codes - 60 70 80 (not 60-70-80)
       avoid using spaces in account numbers unless they are very long (like an International Bank Account Number)
   
   For example:
   
   Transfer the fee to the following account within 5 working days of emailing your form:
   
       sort code - 80 26 50
       account number - 10014069
       account name - The Public Trustee
   
   Banned words
   
   See Words to avoid
   baseline

   Behavioural Insights team
   
   Upper case if it’s a specific, named team. Always lower case for team and generic names like research team, youth offending team.
   Bereavement Payment
   
   Upper case.
   Blind Person’s Allowance
   
   Upper case.
   block list
   
   Use block list as the noun and block as the verb. Do not use black list or blacklist.
   blog post
   
   Use 2 words when referring to an article published on a blog. A ‘blog’ is the site on which a blog post is published.
   board
   
   Always lower case unless it’s part of a proper title: so upper case for the Judicial Executive Board, but lower case for the DFT’s management board.
   bold
   
   Only use bold to indicate interface elements in text that are explicitly telling the user what to do, for example:
   
       Select Start.
       Enter your information then select Done.
   
   Use inverted commas when referring to interface elements in non-instructional contexts, for example: “The ‘Done’ button will always be at the bottom of the page.”
   
   Use bold sparingly - using too much will make it difficult for users to know which parts of your content they need to pay the most attention to.
   
   Do not use bold in other situations, for example to emphasise text.
   
   To emphasise words or phrases, you can:
   
       front-load sentences
       use headings
       use bullets
   
   Brackets
   
   Use (round brackets).
   
   Do not use round brackets to refer to something that could either be singular or plural, like ‘Check which document(s) you need to send to DVLA.’
   
   Always use the plural instead, as this will cover each possibility: ‘Check which documents you need to send to DVLA.’
   
   Use [square brackets] for explanatory notes in reported speech or for placeholder text:
   
   “Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.”
   
   “Witnessed by [signature of witness].”
   Brexit
   
   You can use the term ‘Brexit’ to provide historical context, but it’s better to use specific dates where possible. For example, use:
   
       ‘31 December 2020’ rather than ‘Brexit’ or ‘when the UK left the EU’
       ‘before 31 December 2020’ rather than ‘during the transition period’
       ‘after 1 January 2021’ rather than ‘after the transition period’
   
   Britain
   
   See Great Britain
   British citizen
   
   One of 6 types of British nationalities. See British people.
   British national
   
   See British people.
   British people
   
   Reference British nationals by their activity where possible, for example British tourists, British farmers. If you’re talking about them in the general sense, use British people.
   
   Do not use British nationals unless you need to refer to them in a legal context, for example in eligibility criteria. Do not use British citizen unless you’re referring to people with that particular type of British nationality.
   BTEC National Diploma
   
   Upper case.
   Bullet points and steps
   
   You can use bullets to make text easier to read. Make sure that:
   
       you always use a lead-in line
       you use more than one bullet
       the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
       you use lower case at the start of the bullet
       you do not use more than one sentence per bullet - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
       you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
       you do not make the whole bullet a link if it’s a long phrase
       you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
       there is no full stop after the last bullet
   
   Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. But it’s sometimes necessary to add a short phrase to clarify whether all or some of the points apply. For example, ‘You can only register a pension scheme that is one of the following:’
   
   The number and type of examples in a list may lead the user to believe the list is exhaustive. This can be dealt with by:
   
       checking if there are other conditions (or if the list is actually complete)
       listing the conditions which apply to the most users and removing the rest
       consider broader terms in the list which capture more scenarios (and could make the list exhaustive)
       creating a journey to specialist content to cover the remaining conditions
   
   Steps
   
   Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You do not need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with appropriate Markdown) in steps. Steps end in a full stop because each should be a complete sentence.

   Capitalisation
   
   DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

       departments (specific government departments - see below)
       the Civil Service, with lower case for ‘the’

       header cells in tables: Annual profits

       department or ministry - never Department or Ministry, unless referring to a specific one: Ministry of Justice, for example

       do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017
       when space is an issue - in tables or publication titles, for example - you can use truncated months: Jan, Feb
       we use ‘to’ in date ranges - not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example:
           tax year 2011 to 2012
           Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, do not separate with a comma)
           10 November to 21 December
       do not use quarter for dates, use the months: ‘department expenses, Jan to Mar 2013’
       when referring to today (as in a news article) include the date: ‘The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…’

   For example: ‘HMPO is the sole issuer of UK passports. They will send your new passport within 3 weeks’
   
   The definite article can be used when referring to the organisation by its full name, but should not be used with the organisation’s acronym: ‘You should contact the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency if…’ but ‘You should contact DVSA if…’
   
   You should only use ‘we’ if it’s clear which organisation you’re referring to.

   Do not refer to the withdrawal agreement to let users know if:
   
       they fall into a particular group
       a rule applies to them
   
   Instead, refer to things which allow a user to understand which group they fall into - for example, if they were living in an EU country before 1 January 2021.

   Words to avoid
   
   Plain English is mandatory for all of GOV.UK so avoid using these words:
   
       agenda (unless it’s for a meeting), use ‘plan’ instead
       advance, use ‘improve’ or something more specific
       collaborate, use ‘work with’
       combat (unless military), use ‘solve’, ‘fix’ or something more specific
       commit/pledge, use ‘plan to x’, or ‘we’re going to x’ where ‘x’ is a specific verb
       counter, use ‘prevent’ or try to rephrase a solution to a problem
       deliver, use ‘make’, ‘create’, ‘provide’ or a more specific term (pizzas, post and services are delivered - not abstract concepts like improvements)
       deploy (unless it’s military or software), use ‘use’ or if putting something somewhere use ‘build’, ‘create’ or ‘put into place’
       dialogue, use ‘spoke to’ or ‘discussion’
       disincentivise, use ‘discourage’ or ‘deter’
       empower, use ‘allow’ or ‘give permission’
       facilitate, say something specific about how you’re helping - for example, use ‘run’ if talking about a workshop
       focus, use ‘work on’ or ‘concentrate on’
       foster (unless it’s children), use ‘encourage’ or ‘help’
       impact (unless talking about a collision), use ‘have an effect on’ or ‘influence’
       incentivise, use ‘encourage’ or ‘motivate’
       initiate, use ‘start’ or ‘begin’
       key (unless it unlocks something), usually not needed but can use ‘important’ or ‘significant’
       land (unless you’re talking about aircraft), depending on context, use ‘get’ or ‘achieve’
       leverage (unless in the financial sense), use ‘influence’ or ‘use’
       liaise, use ‘work with’ or ‘work alongside’
       overarching, usually superfluous but can use ‘encompassing’
       progress, use ‘work on’ or ‘develop’ or ‘make progress’
       promote (unless talking about an ad campaign or career advancement), use ‘recommend’ or ‘support’
       robust (unless talking about a sturdy object), depending on context, use ‘well thought out’ or ‘comprehensive’
       slim down (unless talking about one’s waistline), use ‘make smaller’ or ‘reduce the size’
       streamline, use ‘simplify’ or ‘remove unnecessary administration’
       strengthening (unless it’s strengthening bridges or other structures), depending on context, use ‘increasing funding’ or ‘concentrating on’ or ‘adding more staff’
       tackle (unless talking about fishing tackle or a physical tackle, like in rugby), use ‘stop’, ‘solve’ or ‘deal with’
       transform, describe what you’re doing to change the thing
       utilise, use ‘use’
   
   Avoid using metaphors - they do not say what you actually mean and lead to slower comprehension of your content. For example:
   
       drive, use ‘create’, ‘cause’ or ‘encourage’ instead (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
       drive out (unless it’s cattle), use ‘stop’, ‘avoid’ or ‘prevent’
       going/moving forward, use ‘from now on’ or ‘in the future’ (it’s unlikely we are giving travel directions)
       in order to, usually not needed - do not use it
       one-stop shop, use ‘website’ (we are government, not a retail outlet)
       ring fencing, use ‘separate’ or when talking about budgets use ‘money that will be spent on x’
   
   With all of these words you can generally replace them by breaking the term into what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.
